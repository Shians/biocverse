# biocverse

## Goal of project 

Create an interactive data visualization of Bioconductor packages. 

## Use cases

1. New users: given a task (BiocView), show me all the packages for that view in a graph that shows how "important" (e.g, hub nodes in the graph).
2. Experienced users: that want to discover new packages: new packages highlighted in the context of their network (packages for similar tasks).
3. New developers: to better understand which biocViews are appropriate and which important packages exist for the task.

## Roadmap

For details on tasks and timelines, take a look at the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
